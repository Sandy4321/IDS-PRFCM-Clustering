# A Cloud Intrusion Detection System Using Novel PRFCM Clustering and KNN Based Dempster-Shafer Rule

DOI: [10.4018/IJCAC.2016100102](http://www.igi-global.com/article/a-cloud-intrusion-detection-system-using-novel-prfcm-clustering-and-knn-based-dempster-shafer-rule/173770)

An Anomaly based method for implementing Intrusion Detection Systems is described which uses a Novel PRFCM Clustering and KNN based Dempster-Shafer Rule. The PRFCM Clustering is a modification to the existing FCM Clustering Algortihm. Pre-Processed NSL-KDD dataset was used to get the results. The results are evaluated and compared with original FCM algortihm in the paper.

## Getting Started

The following code is implemented in Java 8 environment. In order to execute the code dataset needs to be downloaded.  

### Dataset

The experiments are performed on NSL-KDD Train and Test Dataset. These dataset were pre-processed and normalized before use. It can be obtained from the following source. 

[NSL-KDD Dataset](http://www.unb.ca/research/iscx/dataset/iscx-NSL-KDD-dataset.html)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
