An Anomaly based method for implementing Intrusion Detection Systems is described which uses a Novel PRFCM Clustering and KNN based Dempster-Shafer Rule. The PRFCM Clustering is a modification to the existing FCM Clustering Algortihm. Pre-Processed NSL-KDD dataset was used to get the results. The results are evaluated and compared with original FCM algortihm in the paper.

## Getting Started

The following code is implemented in Java 8 environment. In order to execute the code dataset needs to be downloaded.  

### Dataset

The experiments are performed on NSL-KDD Train and Test Dataset. These dataset were pre-processed and normalized before use. It can be obtained from the following source.
